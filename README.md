# pyAPM

A lightweight Python wrapper for the AppNeta Performance Manager API

See example.py for usage examples.
Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install dependencies (only 'Requests' at this time).

Not an official AppNeta product.  Caveat emptor.


CURRENT STATUS:

- Appliance, Alert Profile, Diagnostic, Flow, Organization, Path and Saved List classes are present.
- WebApplication class partially complete.

TO-DO:

- Better examples.
- Unit tests.
- Improved exception handling.
- Maybe some bug fixing.
